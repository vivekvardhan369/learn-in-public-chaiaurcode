HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and responses over the internet. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. The communication usually takes place over TCP/IP, but any reliable transport can be used. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can also be used.

HTTP is a request-response protocol. A client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a connection with a server. The server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta-information, and possible entity-body content.

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the message or messages to be exchanged by the application programs at each and end have been exchanged. TCP is reliable because it provides error checking and re-transmission of packets. It provides a flow control mechanism to ensure that the sender does not send data too fast for the receiver to process. It also provides congestion control to ensure that the network is not overloaded with too much traffic.

FTP: File Transfer Protocol
FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP is built on a client-server architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.

IP: Internet Protocol
IP is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking and essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.

URL: Uniform Resource Locator
A URL is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

DNS: Domain Name System
DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet.

Payload
The payload is the actual data that is being transmitted. It is the part of the transmitted data that is the actual intended message. The payload does not include the headers or metadata sent as part of the data transmission.

Cache
A cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot.

Cookie
A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user's browsing activity. They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers.
